# BigFoot

## The Idea.
The idea behind this project is to get a open-source Image/Asset management tool which store images to a disk or S3 compatible storage and give controls to the user for manipulating/transforming for reuse on other projects or just use as a media vault.

## Technology stack.
- Laravel, for APIs and user interface.
- Minio, for cloud storage on local. (ideally you should use AWS S3 or Digitalocean spaces if not having local server.)
- Mysql, for database storage.
- Docker, for local development.

## Roadmap.
- Yet to be added.
